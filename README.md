COGS 121 Project

# Setup Guide
1) Get Node 8.11.1, that is the latest long term stable version. If you have a different version, or you want to use multiple versions you should get a node version manager otherwise it is really painful.

2) Clone the Git repository

3) Run npm install to get the latest set of packages

4) Use `node server.js` to run the server or `nodemon` (`npm install -g nodemon` to install it) to get the app to automatically reload when you make changes to it.

5) Write some good code using VSCode or Vim or both
