## Idea Proposal ##
Our project idea is to create a skill/habit-building app that sends reminders for the habit/skills and tracks and shows progress. Users can see monthly progress through a calendar a view along with daily and monthly statistics and graphs. Users also have the option to track their progress by using the built-in timer. 

To spice up the app, we want to add a social aspect to it. Potentially, connecting with facebook, email or a friend system that will help motivate the person using the app. One way to apply "accountability", some sort of picture confirmation or a statement regarding how it went. Might try to add a reward/punishment for doing or not doing by posting through a community(friends in app, facebook or some other way)

Our stretch goal is to enable the app to interface with a calendar API so that when the user schedules a skill/habit into their personal calendar, the app will be able to identify the skill/habit, time length, etc. This way, the user does not have to remember to track or log the skill/habit in the app itself.
