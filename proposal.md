## Idea Proposal ##
Our project idea is to create a skill/habit-building app that sends reminders for the habit/skills and tracks and shows progress. Users can see monthly progress through a calendar a view along with daily and monthly statistics and graphs. Users also have the option to track their progress by using the built-in timer. 

Our stretch goal is to enable the app to interface with a calendar API so that when the user schedules a skill/habit into their personal calendar, the app will be able to identify the skill/habit, time length, etc. This way, the user does not have to remember to track or log the skill/habit in the app itself.  

Another stretch goal would be to incorporate a social aspect where you can share when you have accomplished a certain goal/number of hours on a habit. Our hope is to possibly connect people through a friend adding system or even to use a facebook login and connect with others who are on facebook.
